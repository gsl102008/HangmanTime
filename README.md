# HangmanTime
# Overview
I developed a Hangman game in C++ to help my understanding of the language's syntax and reinforce programming concepts. The software allows players to guess letters to uncover a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. This game uses variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and data structures from the STL (Standard Template Library). The purpose of creating this software was to challenge myself to apply C++ language features in a practical project while working on my problem-solving skills through implementing game mechanics.

## Development Environment
The software was developed using the following tools:

- **C++**
# Useful Websites
During the development process, the following websites were invaluable resources:

- [C PlusPlus](https://cplusplus.com/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

# Future Work
In future iterations of the project, I plan to:

- Add a feature to select word categories (e.g., music, actors, actresses, countries, foods).
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Incorporate sound effects or animations for better gameplay.
